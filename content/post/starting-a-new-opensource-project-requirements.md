When starting a new open source project, apart from coding following are the things that need to be done.

## Docs

  - README
  - LICENSE
  - How to install?
  - How to use?
  - Code of conduct guidelines
  - Copyright
  - Issue template like `.github` in repo.

## Developer docs

  - How to install for developer?
  - Developer docs
  - Contribution guidelines
  - Team meetings info
  - Team communication channels
  - Issue label guidelines
  - Coding standards
  - Code placement doc, or something that explains the way code is ordered

## Development

  - `Makefile`
  - Unit tests
  - Functional tests
  - Coverage check
  - CI for automatic tests
  - Distro based package


This is just few things that I could think of, please suggest if you know more in comments.
