If you are playing Counter Strike on Steam on linux you might be wondering how do I install
new maps in the game. So here are steps to install maps.

![Counter Strike Condition Zero](/images/cs-maps/Counter-Strike-Condition-Zero-pc-game-585x300.jpg "Counter Strike Condition Zero")


All the game maps for Counter Strike - Condition Zero are stored in following path:

```bash
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/czero/maps
```
Format of the map files is `.bsp`.


So download the map files from over internet and then put in this location and now you should
be able to see the maps in game.

Happy Gaming, **fire in the hole** :-) !!
