Recently came accross a video which talks about why over time productivity of people goes down? It said most of times we are in performace mode and seldom in learning mode.

Being a Software Engineer I am fortunate or unfortunate enough that I don't do same task twice. Everytime I am doing something it is different in someways. And if I do something repetitive I try to automate it, that's what computers are great at,  monotonous repetitive work. So I *learn as I go*.

This methodology of *learn as you do* works great, but how efficient it is? If I am gonna work on some new thing and if I know nothing about it I can still google about it and get the task done. But I also believe that if I learn about the thing I am gonna do I can do the task more efficiently and with better understanding make better decisions.

For e.g. I don't know much about Ansible apart from the concepts like playbooks and the way Ansible works. Now if I get a task of writing Ansible playbook for setting up OpenShift cluster, I might get it done in some ways but it would be the worst Ansible playbook anyone has ever seen.

So the point being the tools or technology I use, the better I know about it, I will make better use of it.

To apply this to everyday tools I have identified certain tasks that I am not good at. And something I am working on right now is *typing*. I do typing but only using certain fingers not using all of them. So my typing speed has reached to the treshold. So I had read about a typing technique called touch typing that people do and with that you get amazing typing speed, so you use all your fingers move hand less around keyboard.

I am learning touch typing from typingclub.com which is really amazing. So now I start my day with 30mins typing exercise. To aid to this I also got a TVS Gold mechanical keyboard, it's noisy but the typing experience is awesome.

Now this area being identified I am working on other things, as I go ahead. I will keep updating this blog with new things I did.
